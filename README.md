# Keyper

Minimalistic implementation of an authorization server according to OAuth2 specifications.

## Warning

This is a personal side project I'm developing while learning about OAuth2, distributed authorization, authentication and security in distributed systems.
I'm also using this repository to incorporate some recent learnings about software architecture and design in distributed systems.
As a consequence, **I strongly advise against relying on this software in any kind of production system**.
